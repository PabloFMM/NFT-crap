                            <p class="ps-4">These general conditions are important for both of us as they set out what we expect from each other, and they also give you helpful info. In the event that you are underage or you do not agree to submit to the conditions listed here, please do not use this website.</p>
                            <p class="ps-4">Please, take your time and check our terms often, as we reserve the right to amend these terms and conditions at any time, and it is possible we change them at some point.</p>

                            <p class="ps-4">NFT Crap is a project willing to make a live action role-playing game based on the blockchain metaverse  that, using NFT’s, provides a platform to enjoy the pleasure of completing quests and solving riddles.</p>
                            <p class="ps-4">Actually, we are on our earliest development steps of the game, but in the meanwhile you can begin to collect NFT-Crap tokens on <a target="_blank" href="https://opensea.io/nft-crap">https://opensea.io/nft-crap</a>. These tokens share good advice and interesting knowledge about NFT’s usage. These NFTs will be very powerful in the LARP (Live Action Role-Play) game as prizes for those early adopters who support our project. </p>
                            <p class="ps-4">As well, NFT-Crap gives a consulting service for anyone interested in receiving information about blockchain development, DAOs, NFTs and DEFi in general.</p>
